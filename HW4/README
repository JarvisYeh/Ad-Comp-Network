1.	Usage
    a)	for each scenario, run PolicyX.py directly (./PolicyX.py), the Automonitor.py contains the function which will be called by PolicyX.py, no need to run it separately.
    b)	Note that each time to run a run policy, the floodlight and mininet need to be restarted since the deletion of alternative flows is not implemented.
    
2.	Logic of three policies
    Policy 1:
        i.	Monitor the throughput of swtich3 regarding to flows from h1 to h3 and h1 to h4. The monitor frequency is once per second.
        ii.	When the throughput of the flows going through s3 increases above 90Mbps, reroute the h1 to h3 flows from “H1 -> S1 -> S3 -> H3“ to “H1 -> S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> H3“
    Policy 2:
        i.	Monitor the throughput of swtich3 regarding to flows from h1 to h3, h1 to h4 and h1 to h5. The monitor frequency is once per second.
        ii.	When the throughput of the flows going through s3 increases above 90Mbps, reroute the h1 to h4 flows from “H1 -> S1 -> S3 -> H4“ to “H1 -> S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> H4“ and reroute the h1 to h5 flows from “H1 -> S1 -> S3 -> H5“ to “H1 -> S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> H5“
    Policy 3:
        i.	Monitor the throughput of swtich3 regarding to flows from h2 to h3 and h1 to h4. The monitor frequency is once per second.
        ii.	When the throughput of the flows going through s3 increases above 90Mbps, reroute the h2 to h5 flows from “H2 -> S2 -> S3 -> H5“ to “H2 -> S2 -> S1 -> S3 -> H5“ .
